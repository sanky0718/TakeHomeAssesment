## Preprocessing Details
All images are auto-oriented and resized to 416x416 pixels. Data Augmentation is not applied due to Hardware constraint. With Data Augmentation accuracy can be increased.

## Model Information
We use the InceptionV3 architecture, leveraging transfer learning. The top layer is replaced to accommodate our number of classes.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Prior to finalizing the model, we conducted hyperparameter tuning. The best parameters identified were:

Units: 128
Dropout Rate: 0.1
Learning Rate: 0.0023327793733607717
The model was trained for 2 epochs during the tuning process. These parameters helped in achieving a model accuracy of approximately 88.37% on the validation set.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The final accuracy achieved on the test set was 0.8837209343910217.

## Model Saving Formats
The trained model is saved in two formats for compatibility and convenience:

HDF5 format: model1.h5
Keras format: my_model1.keras
These files can be used to load the model for further analysis, development, or deployment.

## Dependencies
Requirements.txt file is provided for installing all the packages and modules.

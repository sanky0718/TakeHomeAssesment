## Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
PyTorch 1.7+
Requirements: Run pip install -r requirements.txt from the YOLOv5 repository.


## Hyperparameter Evolution
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 27 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --evolve

Interrupting Evolution
To manually stop the evolution process and check for interim weights:

Interrupt the process in the command line using Ctrl + C.
Check the runs/train/ or runs/evolve/ directories for the last.pt file.
-> Due to Hardware constraint cannat able to execute the above command but using evolve can achieved very good performance and I tried it for 1 iteration and it took around 10 hours to run but received class loss close to 0.0043 and not able to saves the weights because of interuption of memory overflow.


## Weights
Training outputs are saved in runs/train/ or runs/evolve/ directories.
Check these directories for model weights (best.pt and last.pt), performance metrics, and inference results.

## Customization
Edit data.yaml to point to your custom dataset.
Adjust training parameters as needed (e.g., --batch, --epochs).
